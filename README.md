# Keycloak OIDC Adapter based on the Elytron HTTP API

## Overview
This project provides a Keycloak OIDC adapter based on Elytron HTTP API. It is a temporary project for all the work regarding Keycloak and Elytron integration, as well the necessary changes to the Elytron HTTP API in order to support Keycloak capabilities and requirements.

In the future, this adapter can replace the existing WildFly Adapter (or even the Undertow Adapter) in Keycloak with something that provides a more deep and better integration with the underlying container in which Elytron is installed (eg.: WildFly and Undertow standalone).
